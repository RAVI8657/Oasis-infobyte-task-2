                <h2>The Iconic Engineer</h2>
                <p><b>Pichai Sundararajan (born June 10, 1972), better known as Sundar Pichai</b>
                      He is an Indian-born American business executive. He is
                      the chief executive officer (CEO) of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google.

                    Pichai began his career as a materials engineer. Following a short stint at the management
                     consulting firm McKinsey & Co., Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product
                      management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including
                       Google Chrome and ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. In addition, he 
                       went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps. In 2010, Pichai
                        also announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video 
                        format, WebM. The Chromebook was released in 2012. In 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of
                         Google products that he oversaw.
                    
                    Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015, after previously being 
                    appointed Product Chief by CEO Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position
                     at the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company 
                     family. He was appointed to the Alphabet Board of Directors in 2017.</p>
